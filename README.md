# Realtime Doctor Appointments Streaming Pipeline  

## Overview  
This project implements a robust **real-time data streaming pipeline** designed to manage doctor appointment data effectively. It integrates multiple state-of-the-art technologies to create an end-to-end system that:  
1. **Ingests data** from an external API into **PostgreSQL** using **Apache Flink**.  
2. Tracks real-time changes via **Debezium** and streams them to **Apache Kafka**.  
3. **Processes and transforms** data with **Apache Spark**, storing the results in **Snowflake** through **Snowpark**.  
4. **Builds analytical models** using **dbt** to classify appointments as **future** or **past** in Snowflake.  
5. **Orchestrates and automates** the dbt process using **Apache Airflow**.

## Pipeline Architecture  
### **1. API Data Ingestion**  
Fetches real-time doctor appointment data from an external API using Apache Flink and streams it into a **PostgreSQL** database.  

### **2. Change Data Capture (CDC)**  
- **Debezium** monitors PostgreSQL for changes (insert, update, delete).  
- Changes are published to **Apache Kafka** as events.  

### **3. Real-Time Data Processing**  
- **Apache Spark** processes Kafka streams, performing data cleaning and transformations.  
- The processed data is sent to **Snowflake** for warehousing via **Snowpark**.  

### **4. Data Modeling with dbt**  
- dbt builds SQL models to classify **future** and **past** appointments.  
- Models are optimized for analytics and reporting.  

### **5. Orchestration with Airflow**  
- **Apache Airflow** automates and schedules the entire pipeline, ensuring seamless execution and monitoring.

## Technologies Used  
- **Apache Flink**: Real-time data ingestion and processing.  
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database for raw data storage.  
- **Debezium**: Tracks data changes in PostgreSQL (CDC).  
- **Apache Kafka**: Streams CDC events for further processing.  
- **Apache Spark**: Scalable data preprocessing and enrichment.  
- **Snowflake**: Cloud-based data warehousing.  
- **Snowpark**: Efficient data manipulation within Snowflake.  
- **dbt (Data Build Tool)**: SQL-based transformations and analytics.  
- **Apache Airflow**: Orchestrates and automates tasks.  
- **Docker**: Simplifies environment setup and deployment.

## Installation and Setup  

### Prerequisites  
Before setting up the pipeline, ensure you have the following installed:  
- Python 3.8+
- Java 8 or 11
- Docker and Docker Compose  
- Apache Kafka  
- Apache Flink  
- Maven (for building Flink jobs)  
- Apache Spark  
- Snowflake account  
- dbt CLI  
- Apache Airflow  
- Cygwin64 (if using Windows)  

### Steps  

#### 1. **Clone the Repository**  
```bash  
git clone https://github.com/baderanaas/RealtimeStreamingPipeline.git  
cd RealtimeStreamingPipeline  
```  

#### 2. **Install Dependencies**  
```bash  
pip install -r requirements.txt  
```  

#### 3. **Configure Environment Variables**  
Create a `.env` file with the following variables:  
```env  
API_KEY=<your_api_key>  
POSTGRES_URI=<postgres_connection_uri>  
KAFKA_BROKER=<kafka_broker_address>  
SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT=<snowflake_account>  
SNOWFLAKE_USER=<snowflake_user>  
SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD=<snowflake_password>  
SNOWFLAKE_WAREHOUSE=<snowflake_warehouse>  
SNOWFLAKE_SCHEMA=<snowflake_schema>  
SNOWFLAKE_TABLE=<snowflake_table>  
SNOWFLAKE_STREAMING_STAGE=<snowflake_stage>  
```  

#### 4. **Set Up Databases and Services**  
- Start **Apache Flink**:  
  ```bash  
  <flink_location>/flink-1.18.1/bin/start-cluster.sh  
  ```  
- Configure the Snowflake schema for processed data.  

#### 5. **Run the Pipeline**  
- **Initialize Kafka Topics**:  
  Run the `main.py` script to set up Kafka topics:  
  ```bash  
  python main.py  
  ```  
- **Launch Services with Docker**:  
  Ensure Docker Desktop is running, then:  
  ```bash  
  docker-compose up -d  
  ```  
- **Set Up PostgreSQL**:  
  Access the PostgreSQL container and initialize the database:  
  ```bash  
  psql -U postgres -d appointments -W  
  ```  
- **Configure Debezium**:  
  Use the `debezium-config.json` file to create a POST request to `localhost:8083/connectors`.  

- **Run Flink Job**:  
  Navigate to the project directory and run the Flink job:  
  ```bash  
  <flink_location>/flink-1.18.1/bin/flink run -c FlinkWork.DataStreamJob FlinkWork/target/FlinkWork-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar  
  ```  

#### 6. **Automate with Airflow**  
- Start Airflow locally:  
  ```bash  
  astro dev start  
  ```

## Usage  

1. **Ingest Data**: Use Apache Flink to stream data from the API to PostgreSQL.  
2. **Track Changes**: Use Debezium and Kafka to detect and stream real-time changes.  
3. **Process Data**: Leverage Apache Spark for data preprocessing and store the results in Snowflake.  
4. **Transform Data**: Use dbt to build models for analyzing future and past appointments.  
5. **Automate Tasks**: Apache Airflow ensures the pipeline runs seamlessly and on schedule.
